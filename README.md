# Linear Algebra

Hello! Welcome to the basic units behind what I hope will
eventually become a bigger structure. It's a little bare
bones at the moment, but you can ignore that.

In order to participate all you need to do is either load
the included `.ipynb` files in a Jupyter Notebook after
downloading, or you can interact with them directly in
your browser through Google CoLab.

Once logged in via school email or gmail, go to file, open
notebook, the GitHub tab, and in the search area paste:

All current documents should be available there. The first
third of the semester of introduction to linear algebra
will be covered in the first four documents.

HOW TO SUCCEED:

1. get a notebook and pencil

2. follow along as you read the screen

3. hit enter to move onto the next panel and run the code as the code will show you some important consequences or show pretty pictures or some algorithmic interpretations of what is going on in the text

4. pay attention in class. this is mostly to aid in the material and give you a better intuition as you engage it.

5. recognize that the ordering I chose was on purpose, and it doesn't necessarily fit the book's ordering nor is it a guarantee that it will reflect the professor's ordering. that's fine as multiple viewpoints should help a lot!

In conclusion, these are not meant to be hard. They're
gradual and very hand-holdy. Hopefully they're at least a
little fun. If you have any questions please message me,
and other than that, good luck!
