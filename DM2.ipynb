    "Okay. I have a confession. This lesson is going to be difficult. Make sure you have $DM1$ down. This will likely be the hardest thing we go through. That's not to scare you away, but it's meant to really get you to dial in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to $really$ do $\\textbf{proofs}$. There won't be a ton of coding here. I'll try to slip in breaks, but this is probably the most important take away from $\\textbf{discrete math}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the rules for logic functions down we're going to apply them. You've already been introduced to some baby proofs, but now we want to build on that. In the prior lesson we built some scaffolding. Often when doing formal proofs in the future you won't even imagine that the scaffolding is there. Other times you may dive back to the logical underpinnings as guard-rails to assure you're on the right track.\n",

    "To open we need to start with $\\textbf{quantifiers}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember when we talked about sets, and we discussed \"precise when necessary\"? Sometimes we want to be exact. $\\textbf{Quantifiers}$ will aid in that endeavor. They are called such because they will enumerate the scope of our discourse. The main ones are:\n",

    "Let's break it down for a second. The quantifier at the front, $\\color{goldenrod}{\\textit{For all}}\\color{black}{}$, implies we're working across all $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\}$. The next bit, $n>-1$, is just one of those $variable$ truth statements we talked about in $DM1$. Let's call it $P$, and imagine a $P$ column on your truth table. In fact, since the value of $P$ depends on $n$ let's just call it $P(n)$. Rewriting our $\\textbf{proposition}$:\n",

    "$Truth$ $variables$, as I introduced them last time, are just things that vary depending on input. If they depend on some specific value that we can quantify like the above statement, we call them $\\textbf{predicates}$. Here $P(n)$ is $n>-1$ wich is true regardless of what $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ we plug in. By this we say the $\\textbf{proposition}$ $\\color{goldenrod}{\\forall}\\color{black}{}  n\\in \\mathbb{N}$, $P(n)$ is $true$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that something subtle happend. I could randomly choose some $n$ to make $P(n)$ true. That's all well and good. Only when it is true for every $n$ does the $\\textbf{proposition}$ become true. The $\\textbf{quantifier}$ matters a lot.\n",

    "\n",
    "To prove the first proposition we needed to exhaust the $n>-1$ quality for all of $\\mathbb{N}$. For this second one we only needed a single example. Again, the $\\textbf{quantifier}$ matters.\n",

    "\n",
    "I could check if $\\color{purple}{\\exists}\\color{black}{} n\\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ is true pretty easily. All we had to do pick a number. The same goes for disproving $\\color{forestgreen}{\\exists!}\\color{black}{} n\\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n)$. All we needed were two for a counter-example. How did I check $\\color{goldenrod}{\\forall}\\color{black}{} n\\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ though?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well...I didn't. As in $DM1$, there is only finite time at our dispoval so checking across infinity is impossible. I only checked from $0$ to $100000000$. We need a different mechanism to be sure we're right. I already mentioned it, but $\\color{goldenrod}{\\text{every}}\\color{black}{}$ $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ is larger than $-1$ because no member of $\\mathbb{N}$ is negative. Easy, right? By definition this is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well there is something subtle we're doing here when we say $\\color{goldenrod}{\\text{every}}\\color{black}{}$ $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Yes, by definition every number in $\\mathbb{N}$ is larger than $-1$, but why do we know that? How do we know that? Did we check them all?\n",
    "\n",
    "I sound like a bratty preschooler here. It's a dumb question. It's \"obvious\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "Careful. The \"obvious\" idea is dangerous. It can easily lead you to some incorrect conclusions. This time is fine because we already have some intuition built up. We know what $\\mathbb{N}$ is. We understand intuitively what we're doing even if we can't express it mathematically yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are we doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well in our brain, we check $0$ and $0>-1$. Then we check $1$ and $1>-1$. Then we check $2$ and $2>-1$. This mimics the program above. At some point we stop and say, \"That's good enough! All the rest are larger than this so it doesn't matter!\" Similarly the code stops and some point and does the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we $know$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, okay, okay. Don't get annoyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first member of $\\mathbb{N}$. We know that $0>-1$. This is $n=0$, so we'll say that $P(0)$ is true. This doesn't give us $\\color{goldenrod}{\\forall}\\color{black}{}$, but it does give us a $\\textbf{base case}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is very important. I'm going to introduce you to $\\textbf{induction}$. Whenever you see this term you should imagine exploiting infinity to prove that something will continue forever. It's insanely powerful in mathematics and often really poorly understood. Some of that has to do with two competing ideas, $\\textbf{weak induction}$ and $\\textbf{strong induction}$. In actuality, they are logically equivalent. We will prove this in a bit, but for now stick with me. Ignore the weak/strong nonsense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright. Put $P(0)$ in your mind on the left, and line up $P(1)$, $P(2)$, $P(3)$, $\\ldots$, $P(k)$ in order to the right all the way up to some $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$. You can choose any $k$ you want, as long as the elements are in order. Now we're going to $assume$ that each of these is true. We call this the $\\textbf{induction hypothesis}$. It's okay to do this as I will explain in a second.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\vdots\\hphantom{abcde}\\vdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(k): k>-1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Take these all to be true! Just assume we already checked them all, lie or not. Okay...since each of these is set along in increasing order, we don't know about $P(k+1):k+1>-1$. We only know up to $P(k)$ is true. BUT WAIT!!\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k<k+1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true by $0<1$ and adding $k$ to both sides. Since $k>-1$ we see:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-1<k<k+1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice! $-1<k+1$ meaning $P(k+1)$ is true! So if $P(k)$ is true, we know $P(k+1)$ is true. $P(k)\\implies P(k+1)$!\n",
    "\n",
    "This next bit is $extremely$ $important$. As our choice for $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$ was arbitrary, we could choose $k=1$ just as easily as $k=18031820813918201923471092479838479382083292713897112380110831083108204$. It doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This $arbitrarity$ of selection of $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$ is what captures infinity by inferring the truth of its successor. Notice if I set $k=n$, then $\\forall n\\in \\mathbb{N}$, $P(n)\\implies P(n+1)$.\n",

    "$$P(0)\\implies P(1)\\implies P(2)\\implies P(3)\\implies\\ldots\\implies P(n)\\implies P(n+1)\\implies\\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooray! We can now be $really$ certain of what we pretty much already knew, $\\color{goldenrod}{\\forall}\\color{black}{} n\\in \\mathbb{N}, P(n)$. Your intuitive approach about each element $n>-1$ was correct. This was just a more precise way to get a grip of what was actually happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's do a slightly simpler proof instead of $\\textbf{induction}$. Assume we know that $\\mathbb{N}$ has a minimal/smallest element. We haven't proven it, but we can suspect $0\\leq n$ $\\color{goldenrod}{\\text{for all}}\\color{black}{}$ $n$ in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter infinity this time, we will exploit $arbitrarity$ again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we choose a random $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Since $0\\leq n$ by assumption that $0$ is the smallest element in $\\mathbb{N}$, we know that $-1<0\\leq n$ giving us what we want. As our selection of $n$ was arbitrary, we know this holds $\\color{goldenrod}{\\text{for all}}\\color{black}{}$ $n$ in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "NICE! That was quick and easy, and somewhat painless. It was cleaner, and we didn't even use induction. We don't always have to. Conceptually we can often rely on this $arbitrarity$ of selection to carry us through infinite elements. Not always though. Sometimes we have to use induction. I will highlight it once really quickly here when induction is necessary, and then we will move onto other types of proofs.\n",
