    "So, other than the identity matrix and the super cool properities to isolate vectors from a matrix, these $\\text{standard unit vectors}$ have another super power. First up though, why the name? Well they are:\n",

    "\n",
    "They're $\\textbf{untial}$. All this means is that we think of their length as the basic unit of measure in that direction. So we think of the length of $\\color{red}{e_{j}}\\color{black}{}$ as $1$ regardless of which $j\\in \\mathbb{N}$ is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, they're standardized, meaning they're pretty canonically thought of as $\\textit{the}$ unital vectors. There are infinite vectors of length $1$. Think of all the ones that make up the unit circle for example. We use $\\textit{these}$ specific unital vectors because they coordinate nicely with the axes we define. Consequently this means all of their components are $0$ except for a single $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before I just hand you a formula for length, you should know there are some hidden triganometric consequences that will get teased out later. In higher level math courses there are also different ways to define length. For our purpose though:\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the scaled versions of $\\color{red}{e_{1}}\\color{black}{}$ and $\\color{red}{e_{2}}\\color{black}{}$ make up the base and height of the right triangle with $\\color{black}{v_{10}}$ as its hypotenuse. Just plug it into Pythagoras:\n",

Notice that it spit out $|-\\frac{3}{2}|=\\frac{3}{2}$ as the length scalar though. This should make sense algebraically because you just did it and spiritually because length is always positive. As a consequence, though negative signs impact the direction of a vector, they never impact the magnitude/length.\n",

    "Remember I also told you that there were infinite vectors of length $1$. Maybe you didn't believe me, but here's a little trick that will be come useful later.

    "\n",
    "Of course $\\frac{||v||}{||v||}=1$ since length is just a number. So any vector could be forced to be of length $1$. Again then, why are these so special? We're building to that. Patience.
